# TMI.js Docs

## tmi.js - docs

Our project's documentation is very important and is essential when developing an application using our framework. Our documentation is made with Jekyll & Liquid and is hosted on GitHub. Your contribution to this documentation is always appreciated.

This repository does not accept issues, only Pull Requests. If you have any issue with the documentation, feel free to get into the "Twitch API" Discord's "\#tmi" channel, invite link on the [tmi.js repo README](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js).
